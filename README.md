<h1>Snappin OpenSource screenshot application with screenshots pinning feature for Windows</h1>

I created this app that helps me pin screenshots I take on top of all windows to use them as references.

I am willing to keep improving this little app, so if you have any ideas to help with that I would love to get your feedback
